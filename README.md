# Technocolab Machine Learning Engineer Internship Program - Prerequisite Lessons

This repository contains the lessons and projects completed as part of the prerequisite courses for Technocolab's **Machine Learning Engineer Internship Program**. The repository is organized into individual Kaggle notebooks, covering fundamental data Cleaning topics that are essential for machine learning projects.

## Courses Overview

### Course 1: Data Cleaning
The lessons in this course focus on transforming raw data into a clean, usable format, which is crucial for building robust machine learning models. Each lesson addresses a key step in the data cleaning process:

1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Learn techniques to handle missing data by either dropping or filling in values using various methods, including automated workflows.

2. **Scaling and Normalization**
   - Apply transformations to numeric variables to ensure your data has properties such as normal distribution or uniform scaling, which improves model performance.

3. **Parsing Dates**
   - Master the ability to work with date and time data by recognizing and correctly formatting dates into components like day, month, and year.

4. **Character Encodings**
   - Avoid `UnicodeDecodeError` by understanding character encodings in text files, ensuring that text data loads smoothly and without errors.

5. **Inconsistent Data Entry**
   - Efficiently identify and correct typos or inconsistencies in your data, allowing you to standardize values and improve data quality.
